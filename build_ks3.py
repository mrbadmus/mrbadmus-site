"""build_ks3() — the KS3 generator. architecture.md §10.1 phase 1, §8.2, §8.4.

Run it:

    python3 build_ks3.py

**This generator is deliberately standalone and additive.** It writes only under
``mrbadmus_site/ks3/`` and ``ks3/``, and touches nothing else. It never calls
``build_site()``.

Why: ``generate_site_v5.build_site()`` starts with ``shutil.rmtree(output_dir)``
and ends by copying the whole tree over the repo root. Wiring KS3 into it would
mean every KS3 content change triggers a full rewrite of 300+ KS4 pages that
135+ students depend on — and would make §9's "zero KS4 pages changed" gate
impossible to demonstrate. Keeping them separate makes that gate provable by
construction. See the note at the bottom of this file for how to wire it in when
that trade-off is worth making.

Output taxonomy (§8.4). **No year appears in a LESSON path, ever (§4.5).**

    /ks3/index.html                                     KS3 landing — both routes in
    /ks3/<discipline>/index.html                        discipline hub
    /ks3/<discipline>/<unit-slug>/index.html            unit index
    /ks3/<discipline>/<unit-slug>/<lesson-slug>.html    the lesson    ← no year, ever

    the browse layer (§4.5.2, MRB-176 ruling 1) — index pages only:

    /ks3/year-<n>/index.html                            six half-term cards
    /ks3/year-<n>/<half-term>/index.html                subject cards for that half term
    /ks3/year-<n>/<half-term>/<discipline>/index.html   the lessons placed there

§4.5.2 splits §4.5's prohibition rather than relaxing it: year and half term are
the organising axis of the browse layer and remain absent from every lesson URL,
folder and byte. The browse layer is a pure projection of ``half_terms.py``'s
derived placement — reordering the sequence regenerates these index pages and
changes nothing else, which is the property §9's reorder proof already tests.

# ── Cache-bust stamps for shared assets ──────────────────────────────────
# KS3 pages link the same shared CSS as KS4 and must carry the same ?v=<hash>
# stamps, so a token change invalidates both trees at once. Without this, a
# device can keep serving an old cached tokens.css indefinitely — the exact bug
# generate_site_v5.py's cache-bust pass exists to prevent, and KS3 pages were
# shipping without it.
#
# **Hashed from the SOURCE tree (repo_root/shared/), never from output_dir.**
# generate_site_v5.py hashes its own output copy, and the two agree because the
# round-trip keeps source and deployed byte-identical. But build_ks3() is called
# with several different output_dir values — mrbadmus_site/ for the real build
# and a fresh tmp dir for §9's reorder and determinism proofs — and those tmp
# dirs never contain styles.css or nav.css at all. Hashing the output copy would
# make the stamp a function of which directory we happen to be writing to, and
# the reorder proof (which compares a mrbadmus_site/ build against a tmp build,
# byte for byte) would fail on a difference that has nothing to do with
# sequence. The source tree is the one input that is identical in every case.
#
# ks3.css is stamped too. KS4 does not know about it, but it is a shared
# stylesheet with exactly the same staleness problem, and fixing three of four
# would be an odd place to stop.
#
# ⚠️ §8.5's rationale is about CACHING, not about CSS, so it extends to JS
# unchanged — the tuple used to be named VERSIONED_CSS and ks3.js was linked
# with no stamp at all. That was survivable while ks3.js was a stub; it is not
# now that the file carries the prediction gate, the flip cards and the particle
# labs. A device holding an old cached copy would render a lesson whose labs
# never run and whose cards never flip, with no error and nothing to tell the
# student the page is broken. Any future shared asset a KS3 page links goes in
# this tuple — the name is deliberately no longer about stylesheets.

# already uses for the ladder's success criteria.

    ⚖️ THE SELF-CHECK (MRB-196, ruled by Mide 13 Aug 2026). Design's sorter
    reveals eight answers and never asks the student whether they matched, so
    the student commits and never finds out — which Law 4 forbids. The record
    carries `self_check` and it renders ONLY once the evidence is showing,
    because before that there is nothing to compare against. There is no
    `answer` key and there must never be one: nothing on any option button and
    nothing on any row changes by what is picked. The page asks; it does not
    grade.

    Four mystery cells, four true facts each. The student marks every fact
    SETTLES IT or SETTLES NOTHING before anything is revealed. Most settle
    nothing, because they are true of single-celled organisms AND of cells
    inside a body, and the discriminating fact is never the most interesting
    one — cell 4 changes shape and engulfs another cell, and both settle
    nothing, because a white blood cell does both. Discriminators run 1, 2, 2,
    2 so the pattern never degrades into "find the one".

    Before this it rendered as an **empty section**: `r_activity` emitted the
    shell, the eyebrow and the heading and stopped, because the generic shell
    reads `prompt`/`options`/`reveal` and this payload declares
    `instruction`/`choice_labels`/`cases`. Not one of the sixteen judgements
    reached the page. The kind is inherited by 18 CONTRAST lessons.

    ⚖️ MRB-196, ruled by Mide 13 Aug, resolves the inventory's F36. Design
    computes whether the student agreed and then spends it on the why
    paragraph's COLOUR — `--ks3-ink` against `--ks3-ink-body`, about 6 ΔL*
    apart — which is a mark nobody can read and, being a mark at all, sits
    badly beside R3. The computation goes, the why paragraph takes one tone,
    and the self-check asks the student directly. Same shape as the rail on
    MRB-208: where the approved page and a ruling collide, the ruling wins.

    R3 is safe by construction and worth stating, because it looks close to
    the line. The row's ground records whether the FACT settles it — the
    page's own answer, revealed to everyone identically — never whether the
    student said so. The choice buttons carry the chosen tint and nothing
    else, and they are not `.ks3-option`s, so the reveal may disable them

    those keys. It is false of all six of B1's, and the cost was measured
    rather than argued: **b1-03's whole `#s-think` section rendered as
    `! Think again` and nothing else** — 231 characters of markup, both
    authored statements dropped, and no `targets` either so not even a register
    quote. That is an empty block on the approved reference screen for MODEL, a
    family carrying 50 lesson slots.

    b1-01 is the subtler case and the more dangerous one, because it rendered
    something and therefore looked finished: the line a student read was the
    register's (“If something moves on its own it must be alive…”) and not the
    one Design drew (“If it moves and grows, it must be alive.”). The authored
    comment in the record says so in as many words — *"They differ here… and
    the page's line is the one that renders"* — and the build did the opposite.
    So an authored statement now WINS over the register; the register is the
    fallback for a block that names no statement of its own.

    than as a second block: one wrong idea, then another, inside one "Think

# both and none showing neither:
#

#     @media (min-width: 1340px) { side: block; top: none }
#
# ⚖️ BOTH VARIANTS ARE COMPLETION-BASED, AND NOTHING IS TICKED ON LOAD.
# Ruled on MRB-208 (12 Aug, re-affirmed 13 Aug). Design's delivered top bar was
# `IntersectionObserver`-driven only, so it read "4 / 4" with a full accent bar
# for a student who had scrolled to the bottom and answered nothing — and below
# 1340px it is the only rail a student ever sees. The ruling already bound both
# variants and was not scoped to the wide one:
#
#     "here the approved page is wrong and the ruling wins. That is the same
#      shape as the microscope depth table on MRB-210 — where an approved page
#      contradicts a settled fact or a standing ruling, the page gets corrected."
#
# What stays scroll-driven is the side rail's CURRENT ring and the top bar's
# CURRENT LABEL. Those answer "where am I", not "how far have I got", and
# Design drew them that way. The count and the fill are completion, which is
# precisely the defect the ruling named. `shared/ks3.js` owns the state.
